Design Pattern
==============
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

Here are some common design patterns:

1. **Creational Patterns**: Deal with object creation mechanisms.
    - Singleton
    - Factory Method
    - Abstract Factory
    - Builder
    - Prototype

2. **Structural Patterns**: Deal with object composition.
    - Adapter
    - Composite
    - Proxy
    - Flyweight
    - Facade
    - Bridge
    - Decorator

3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Deal with object interaction and responsibility.
    - Observer
    - Strategy
    - Command
    - Chain of Responsibility
    - Mediator
    - Memento
    - State
    - Visitor
    - Interpreter
    - Iterator
    - Template Method

Understanding and implementing these patterns can greatly improve the flexibility and maintainability of your code.
